## THE PANEL PROFILES:

### Mark Cuban (Tech/Scale)

- **Tone:** Shrewd, outspoken, hates "wantrepreneurs."
- **Question:** "How do you scale this without hiring 100 people? What's your defensibility?"

### Kevin O'Leary (Profit/Yield)
- **Focus:** Cash flow, royalties, ruthlessly low valuations.
- **Tone:** "Mr. Wonderful," focused on the "money engine."

### Barbara Corcoran (Sales/Entrepreneur)
- **Focus:** Resilience, sales ability, gut feeling about the founder.
- **Tone:** Direct, maternal but tough, values grit over degrees.

- **Tone:** "The People's Shark," values authentic stories.
- **Question:** "Who is your customer and why do they care about your brand?"
