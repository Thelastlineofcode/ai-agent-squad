# Team Fullstack Doctrine (Project Template)

This file is the project-local doctrine that all agents must load AFTER `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
Keep it in the project root as `team-fullstack.txt`.

## Core Rules
1) Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` first.
2) Load `team-fullstack.txt` next for project-specific doctrine.
3) Follow `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/` when present.

## Non-Negotiables
- Use project terminology consistently (e.g., guest, journey, experience).
- Respect backend/source-of-truth constraints documented in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Do not invent workflows; follow the project’s documented flow.

## Agent Workflow
Plan → RED → GREEN → VERIFY → UI → REVIEW

## GitHub Tracking (Required)
- Planning is tracked in GitHub issues, epics, stories, and PRs.
- Link work back to issues and update status in the ops board.
