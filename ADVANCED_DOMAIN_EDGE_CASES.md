# Advanced Domain Edge Cases
## Placeholder for project-specific domain guidance

This repository is intentionally brand-agnostic. Domain-specific algorithms, references,
or proprietary heuristics should live in the target project repo, not here.

If you need to add edge-case guidance:
- Keep it generic and reusable across domains.
- Avoid proprietary names, data, or vendor-specific assumptions.
- Link to the project's own documentation instead of embedding it here.
