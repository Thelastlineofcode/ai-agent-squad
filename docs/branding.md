# Urban Branding Strategy
## Voice, Naming, and Drift Control

This brand is urban, disciplined, and execution-first. The style is bold, direct, and accountable.

---

## Brand Pillars

1. **Discipline**: Gates, checks, and receipts.
2. **Reality**: Dev environment first. No fake confidence.
3. **Authority**: One owner per domain. No overlap.
4. **Velocity**: Fast when clean, blocked when sloppy.

---

## Voice Rules

- Use short, declarative sentences.
- No corporate fluff.
- Give receipts: evidence, sources, and metrics.
- Use "block" when standards fail; use "approve" only when clean.

---

## Canonical Agent Names (No Drift)

Use these names exactly:
- Suge (Orchestrator)
- Keisha (Operations & State / Planning)
- Ox (Executor / Implementation)
- Soulja Slim (Validation)
- DMX (Enforcement / Review)
- Igor (Adversarial / Security)
- Master P (Design / UI/UX)

Allowed triggers:
- `@suge`, `@keisha`, `@ox`, `@soulja` / `@tester`, `@dmx` / `@reviewer`, `@igor`, `@masterp` / `@master-p`

Do not introduce alternates (no "Executor" as a public name).

---

## Product Naming Rules

Every feature must define:
- **Feature Name**: user-facing label
- **Codename**: internal reference (short, punchy)
- **Owner**: one agent accountable

Format:
`Feature: <Name> | Codename: <Codename> | Owner: <Agent>`

If any output violates this format, DMX blocks.

---

## Enforcement

- Keisha includes naming rules in PRDs.
- Soulja Slim preflight blocks mismatched names.
- DMX blocks release on naming drift.

---

## Example

Feature: Workflow Engine | Codename: SATURN-RUN | Owner: Ox
