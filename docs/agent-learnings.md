## How to Update

Agents add learnings when:
1. **@keisha**: New architecture decisions, patterns discovered during audits
2. **@ox**: Patterns that worked, anti-patterns discovered during implementation
3. **@soulja**: Security findings, performance insights, anti-patterns in tests
4. **@dmx**: Quality insights, tech debt identified during review
