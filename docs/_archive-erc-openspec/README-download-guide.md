## 💡 Pro Tips

**For Travone (Your Profile)**:
- Your astrology domain benefits from dual-mode agents (Soulja-Slim preflight + validation) ✅ You have this
- Your Levite + Jouvae projects need multi-platform deployment → Use `.agents/` folders
- Your AI agent team needs spec-driven handoffs → Use OpenSpec `/changes/` structure
- Your SaaS business needs cost efficiency → OpenSpec saves 30-40% tokens

**Quick Win Opportunity**:
- The `/specs/` folder is your "constitution" for all projects
- The `/changes/` folder is your audit trail + version history
- The `AGENTS.md` files are your cross-platform deployment solution

**Synergies**:
- Your existing team-fullstack.txt + AGENTS.md = super-agent orchestration
- Your Notion docs → Git-versioned `/specs/`
- Your current workflow → AIOP protocol for zero friction
